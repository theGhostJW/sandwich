Sandwich has a built-in notion of *test timing*. Timing can be useful when you have a large test suite and want to understand where it is spending the most time.

The goal of the timing system is to create a nice summary report, ideally in the form of a [flame graph](http://www.brendangregg.com/flamegraphs.html).

You can select a test timer implementation you use in the Sandwich options. The default one targets [SpeedScope](https://www.speedscope.app/), a nice web-based tool for visualizing flame graphs.


### Non-concurrent

The simplest use of timing occurs when we don't have any `parallel` stuff going on, so the tests all run in a single thread. To deal with multiple threads, see the [concurrency](#dealing-with-concurrency) section.

First of all, **every node in the test tree is timed by default**. Thus, the "describe" and "it" nodes in the example below will be timed automatically. You can prevent this by changing the [node options](/docs/node_options#timing).

In addition, you can time arbitrary blocks of code using the `timeAction` function. This function is a `bracket_` style combinator that can be used to wrap an action. In the example below, we use it to wrap some sub-steps within a test.

``` haskell title="https://github.com/codedownio/sandwich/blob/master/demo-timing/app/Main.hs"
timingDemo :: TopSpec
timingDemo = describe "Dinner tests" $ do
  it "Makes dinner" $ do
    pauseSeconds 1
    timeAction "Makes pasta" $ do
      timeAction "Heats water" $ pauseSeconds 1
      timeAction "Boils noodles" $ pauseSeconds 0.8
      timeAction "Decants noodles" $ pauseSeconds 0.7

  it "Cleans up" $ do
    pauseSeconds 1
```

When you run this code using the default implementation, it will output a file `speedscope.json` in the root of the test results. If you drag and drop this file onto SpeedScope, you get a picture like the following. Note that the profile (in the center of the top bar) is "default." In the next section we'll explore using multiple threads (and thus multiple profiles).

## Dealing with concurrency

Flame graphs need to be properly *nested* to be valid. If Frame A starts before Frame B, then Frame B must end before Frame A ends. When you run test subtrees in parallel, it's easy to violate this property and get stack frames that cross over each other. This will result in a malformed JSON file that makes the visualizer unhappy.

The solution is to introduce "profiles" within the test timer to correspond to execution threads, and make sure you run in a single-threaded way *within each profile*. Below is a simple example of this in action. Note that we use the `parallel` keyword at the top level, to cause the two test trees underneath it to run in their own threads. Immediately underneath the `parallel` keyword, we use `withTimingProfile` to switch the profile for the rest of the sub-tree.

```haskell
timingParallelDemo :: TopSpec
timingParallelDemo = parallel $ do
  withTimingProfile "italian" $
    it "Makes Italian dinner" $ do
      pauseSeconds 1
      timeAction "Makes pasta" $ do
        timeAction "Heats water" $ pauseSeconds 1
        timeAction "Boils noodles" $ pauseSeconds 0.8
        timeAction "Decants noodles" $ pauseSeconds 0.7

  withTimingProfile "chinese" $
    it "Makes Chinese dinner" $ do
      pauseSeconds 0.1
      timeAction "Makes rice" $ do
        timeAction "Cooks rice" $ pauseSeconds 0.5
        timeAction "Serves rice" $ pauseSeconds 0.2
      pauseSeconds 0.3
```

## Advanced configuration

You can configure some settings for the test timer as part of the normal `Options` object. To disable the test timer entirely, just switch to the `NullTestTimer`:

```haskell
myOptions = defaultOptions { optionsTestTimerType = NullTestTimerType }
```

Every test timer implementation has some implementation-specific options. For example, you can pass an arg with `SpeedScopeTestTimerType` to cause it to emit a raw timing data file in addition to the JSON file. This is a simple event-based format with one timing event per line, and it can be useful to debug parallelism issues or convert to another format.
