-- | Previously we got the screen resolution on Linux using the X11 Haskell library.
-- This was a troublesome dependency because it wouldn't build on Hackage, forcing us to upload
-- sandwich-webdriver documentation manually.
-- It also caused problems when trying to make the demos easy to run on a clean machine or a Mac.
-- Instead, we implement platform-specific getResolution functions.
-- On Linux, the simplest way seems to be to parse the output of xrandr. This is the approach taken by
-- at least one other library: https://github.com/davidmarkclements/screenres/blob/master/linux.cc
-- The other way to do it would be to load the x11 and/or xinerama libraries like is done here:
-- https://github.com/rr-/screeninfo/blob/master/screeninfo/enumerators/xinerama.py
-- but again, that would require users to install those libraries. xrandr itself seems like an easier
-- dependency.
